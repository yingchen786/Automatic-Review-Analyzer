# Automatic-Review-Analyzer
course work project to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews
The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.
Tasks:
1. Implement and compare three types of linear classifiers: the perceptron algorithm, the average perceptron algorithm, and the Pegasos algorithm.

2. Use your classifiers on the food review dataset, using some simple text features.

3. Experiment with additional features and explore their impact on classifier performance.
